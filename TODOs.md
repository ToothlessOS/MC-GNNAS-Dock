TODO list on getting this repo ready for release

1. Get graph creation scripts from the server and make sure they are working as intended
2. Host our dataset extracted and cleaned from PDBBind
3. Clean up the main codebase and port it here (including the dependencies)
4. Create utilities for visualizing the results
5. Write the README file

WARNING: The scoring function in the current repo is not updated!!!
NOTE: Switching between MLP and Residual decoders require the switch of filenames! Simple but not elegant solution lol.
